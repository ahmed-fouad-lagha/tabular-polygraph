-------------------------------
Membership inference attack: can an adversary determine whether a
specific real record was used to train the generator?

Methodology (shadow model approach, simplified):
  A "member" is a real training record.
  A "non-member" is a held-out real record not seen during training.
  We score each by its distance to its nearest synthetic neighbour.
  Members are expected to be closer (memorisation signal).
  Attack advantage = AUC - 0.5  (0 = no advantage, 0.5 = perfect attack).
